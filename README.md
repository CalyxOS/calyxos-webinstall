# Android web installer

This is an easy-to-use web installer for Android-based operating systems that runs entirely in the browser. It uses WebUSB, which is supported by Chromium and its derivatives, and my [fastboot.js](https://github.com/kdrag0n/fastboot.js) library for flashing. This allows it to work on computers and Android devices software with no additional software or command-line tools.

If you have a device officially supported by [ProtonAOSP](https://github.com/ProtonAOSP), you can try flashing it with the official instance of this web installer at [ProtonAOSP web installer](https://protonaosp.kdrag0n.dev/install/web/?utm_source=github&utm_campaign=android-webinstall).

## Adapting for other ROMs

By default, this installer is configured for the ProtonAOSP production environment, but it was built with reusability in mind. It can be adapted to other ROM projects with only configuration changes.

You can start with the following Yarn commands:

- `npm install`
- `npm run dev`
- `npm run build`
- `npm run lint`

All configuration is in `src/config.js` and `.env`, and the release index at `public/releases/index.json` is fetched from the root of the domain hosting the installer. You may also want to change the favicon at `public/favicon.png`.

### Using docker

Build the docker image: `docker build --tag YOUR_TAG .` or `npm run docker-build`

Run the app in development: `docker run --rm -p 5173:5173 YOUR_TAG`

Create a production build:

```
mkdir docker_dist
docker run --rm -v ./docker_dist:/app/dist YOUR_TAG npm run build
```

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you adapt this installer or make other improvements to it, please contribute the improvements back to the official repository instead of forking it and keeping the changes to yourself. There are many rough edges that need to be improved upon.
